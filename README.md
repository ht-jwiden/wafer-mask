## wafer-mask

**This is a simple 3D viewer for simulating an "art" silicon wafer with an image mask. The program uses WebGL via Three.js**  

\*I created this program to support myself and other students in a nanomanufacturing course, where our first assignment involved designing an 'art' wafer. The goal was to deepen our understanding of the photolithography masking process by creating this wafer.

> \*ChatGPT was used heavily for the entire program as I am not familiar with Three.js and just wanted to make this as a fun mini-project.
